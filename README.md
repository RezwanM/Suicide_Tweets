# Suicide_Tweets

This repository contains a python script that can classify tweets as being 'neutral' or 'at risk' in order to detect suicidal tweets. An SGD classifier (i.e. a linear classifier with SGD optimization) is used. The dataset is included in a CSV file containing two columns: label and tweet. Label has two values: 1 (i.e. at risk) and 0 (i.e. neutral).
